# Marvel-employee-tracker

## Description
As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business. For challenge assignment 12 as the developer I had a little bit more fun with this challenge. I created a Marvel employee tracker that will use inquirer and mysql2 in order to achieve the goals of the assignment. As the developer, tables needed to be created that would contain departments, role, and employee info. The assignment was done when the tables were created with data and when the user is able to update and add data to any of the existing tables.

## Usage
Prompted through the terminal with a series of questions that will be seen through the walkthrough video.
